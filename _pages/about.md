Erfan, pronounced as [/er'fan/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzKjyZWchag), means wisdom and inner knoledge in Persian Literature. <br><br>
I am an MSc Economics student at [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/) starting in 2024. I graduated with a BSc degree in Economics from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). My research interests include computational economics, financial economics, and policy analysis. I also enjoy exploring topics in applied microeconomics.
