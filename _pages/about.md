Erfan, pronounced as [/er'f…ën/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzKjyZWchag), means wisdom and inner knowledge in Persian literature. <br><br>
I am an MSc Economics student at [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/), starting in 2024 and graduating in 2025. I graduated with a BSc degree in Economics from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). My research interests include economics of innovation and policy analysis. I also enjoy exploring topics in microfoundations and financial economics.
